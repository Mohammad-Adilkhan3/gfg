-->inputs are an array and its size , transition point is a point where the value becomes 1.
In this problem we need to find the index where 1 occurs in an array
if there is no 1 we can return -1.


def transitionPoint(self, arr, n): 
        # Code here
        if 1 in arr:
            res=arr.index(1)
        else:
            res=-1
        return res
