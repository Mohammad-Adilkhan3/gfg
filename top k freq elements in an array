Given a non-empty array nums[] of integers of length N, find the top k elements which have the highest frequency in the array.
If two numbers have same frequencies, then the larger number should be given more preference.
code:
def topK(self, nums, k):-->function for req op
	    from collections import Counter-->module to count each element of an array
		#Code here
        count_dict = Counter(nums)-->stores every element freq
    
        sorted_elements = sorted(count_dict.keys(), key=lambda x: (-count_dict[x],-x))-->all the keys are sorted in descending order with help of lambda function here "-" indicates to reverse the order.
        
        return sorted_elements[:k]-->returns the top k frq elements using slicing.
