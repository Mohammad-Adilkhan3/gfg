Given a positive integer N, return the Nth row of pascal's triangle.
Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients formed by summing up the elements of previous row.
The elements can be large so return it modulo 109 + 7.
Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
Output: 
1 3 3 1
Explanation: 
4th row of pascal's triangle is 1 3 3 1.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Output: 
1 4 6 4 1
Explanation: 
5th row of pascal's triangle is 1 4 6 4 1.
Your Task:
Complete the function nthRowOfPascalTriangle() which takes n, as input parameters and returns an array representing the answer. You don't to print answer or take inputs.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N2)
code:
def nthRowOfPascalTriangle(self,n):
	    # code here
	    mod = 10**9 + 7
	    row=[1]

        if n == 0:
            return [1]
    
        for i in range(1, n):
            new_row = [0] * (i + 1)
            new_row[0], new_row[-1] = 1, 1
    
            for j in range(1, i):
                new_row[j] = (row[j - 1] + row[j]) % mod
    
            row = new_row
    
        return row
